Cisco Packet tracer -> simulation tool -> Network -> Add device using cables and wires

Device -> 5 Tabs 

1) Physical Tab:
The Physical tab provides an interface for interacting with the device including powering it on or off or installing different modules, such as a wireless network interface card (NIC).

2) Config Tab:
For intermediate devices such as routers and switches, there are two ways to access device configurations. Configurations can be accessed via a Config tab, which is a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Configurations can also be accessed using a command line interface (CLI).

3) CLI Tab:
The CLI tab provides access to the command line interface of a Cisco device. Using the CLI tab requires knowledge of device configuration with IOS.

4) Desktop Tab:
For some end devices, such as PCs and laptops, Packet Tracer provides a desktop interface that gives you access to IP configuration, wireless configuration, a command prompt, a web browser, and other applications.

5) Services Tab:
A server has all of the functions of a host with the addition of one more tab, the Services tab. This tab allows a server to be configured with common server processes such as HTTP, DHCP, DNS, or other services.
